# Loan-Risk-Prediction
This project aims to build machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Using a dataset of borrower information and loan attributes, we explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training (with logistic regression as a baseline). The end goal is to evaluate model performance using metrics such as ROC curves and precision, and provide a foundation for more advanced approaches in credit risk modeling.

## Virtual Environments
The notebooks have requirements (described in `requirements.txt`) such as the openai library, regex, and pandas. A Python best practice for downloading packages necessary for your code is using **virtual environments**.

## Why Use Virtual Environments?
Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. By isolating the project's dependencies, you ensure that each project has access to only the packages it needs, avoiding conflicts between package versions and making it easier to manage package versions across multiple projects.

## Creating and Activating Virtual Environments
There are multiple ways to use virtual environments in Python, including through the use of Anaconda or the built-in venv module. Here, we focus on the venv module, which is included in the Python Standard Library.

### Using venv
Before creating the environment, make sure you have **Python 3.13.5** installed.  
You can check with:
```
python --version
```

If you donâ€™t already have Python 3.13.5:

- **macOS/Linux (recommended with pyenv):**
  ```bash
  pyenv install 3.13.5
  pyenv local 3.13.5
  ```

- **Windows:**
  Download the official 3.13.5 installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3135/) and install it.  
  Then check:
  ```bash
  py -3.13 --version
  ```

1. Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment **with Python 3.13.5**, run:

- macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  python3.13 -m venv venv
  ```

- Windows:
  ```bash
  py -3.13 -m venv venv
  ```

This command creates a directory named `venv` in your current directory, which will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the pip library which can be used to install other packages.

2. Activating the Virtual Environment

The virtual environment must be activated before use. Activation scripts are located within the venv directory.

On macOS and Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:

```
./venv/Scripts/activate
```
or
```
./venv/bin/activate
```
(the directory might differ on your system)
After activation, your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated virtual environment, indicating that any Python or pip commands you run will operate within the virtual environment.

3. Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project's dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs the specified packages into the virtual environment.

4. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To exit the virtual environment and use your global Python environment again, simply run:

```
deactivate
```
This command deactivates the virtual environment, returning you to your systemâ€™s global Python environment.
